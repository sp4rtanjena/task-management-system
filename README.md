    ```json
    { "message": "Task created successfully" }
    ```

    ```json
    { "message": "Internal server error" }
    ```
- **Example:**
  - **Request:**
    ```json
    {
      "todo": "Complete the task API documentation"
    }

    { "message": "Task created successfully" }
    ```

### GET /api/tasks/get
- **Description:** Retrieves all tasks for the authenticated user.

      },
      ...
    ]
    ```
  - `500 Internal Server Error:` Something went wrong on the server.
    ```json
    { "message": "Internal server error" }
    ```

## Authentication Middleware
- **Purpose:** Ensures that the user is authenticated before accessing task management endpoints.
- The middleware checks for the presence of a valid JWT in the Authorization header (`Bearer <token>`).
- If the token is valid, the user ID is extracted from the token and added to the `req` object as `req.userId`, allowing access to the userâ€™s tasks.
- If the token is missing or invalid, a `401 Unauthorized` response is returned.

---

## Error Handling
For all requests:
- If there is an internal server error, a generic `500 Internal Server Error` response will be returned.
- If the request cannot be processed due to invalid input (e.g., missing required fields), an appropriate error message with a `400 Bad Request` status will be returned.

---

## Notes
- All task-related endpoints require authentication, which means the user must include a valid JWT token in the Authorization header of their requests.
- JWT token expiry is set to 1 hour, after which the user will need to log in again to get a new token.
